<h1> Query Mate: GPT3 Powered SQL Tool</h1>
<p> As AI technology boomed into the tech scene in 2022, I was facinated by ChatGPT and the abilities/developments of using artificial intelligence, so I decided to build a simple Vue 3 app which utilised the GPT3 API to create a SQL Query Generator Tool </p>

<h3> Application Functionality </h3>
<p> Query mate allows a user to input SQL table schema configurations before proceeding to a text box UI which allows the user to query their schemas and ask the GPT AI to suggest the best way of accessing the different datasets via an SQL query string. </p>
